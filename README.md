As you're learning, data professionals working on modeling projects use featuring engineering to help them determine which attributes in the data can best predict certain measures.

In this activity, you are working for a firm that provides insights to the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional North American basketball league. You will help NBA managers and coaches identify which players are most likely to thrive in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.

To do this, you will analyze a subset of data that contains information about NBA players and their performance records. You will conduct feature engineering to determine which features will most effectively predict whether a player's NBA career will last at least five years. The insights gained then will be used in the next stage of the project: building the predictive model.
